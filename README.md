# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Python's Tkinter library. The game features a graphical user interface where two players can play against each other on the same computer.

## Features

- Two-Player Mode: The game supports two players, taking turns to play as "O" and "X".
- GUI-Based: The game is built using Tkinter, providing a clean and interactive graphical user interface.
- Automatic Winner Detection: The game checks for a winner after each move and displays the result. If there's no winner and the board is full, it declares the game a draw.
- Reset Functionality: Automatically resets the board after a game ends.
